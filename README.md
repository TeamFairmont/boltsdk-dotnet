**BoltSDK for C# / .NET**
----------

This SDK is intended to ease the creation of workers for use with the bolt engine. It depends on two libraries:

- https://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet.html
- http://www.newtonsoft.com/json

The SDK can be referenced by including the BoltSDK csproj in your solution. There is a basic example worker in the AMQP Bolt Example project for reference.
